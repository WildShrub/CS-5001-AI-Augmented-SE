You are a software engineer refactoring Python code.

## Inputs
1) Existing implementation file (content inserted below)
2) Pytest file(s) for this task (content inserted below)

## Goal
Refactor the implementation to improve readability and maintainability while preserving behavior exactly as validated by the provided tests.

## Guidelines
The return type of a refactored function should be the same as the the original function's return type.
Retain all function signitures and variable names.
Do not change edge case behavior.

## Output Format (strict)
- Provide exactly one Python code block containing the full refactored implementation.
- After the code block, provide the checklist in 5 to 10 bullets.
- Do NOT include any additional text.
