## Output

```python
def count_uppercase_letters(input_string):
    """Count the number of uppercase letters in the input string."""
    count = 0
    for char in input_string:
        if 'A' <= char <= 'Z':
            count += 1
    return count
```

- Renamed the function to be more descriptive (`upper_ctr` → `count_uppercase_letters`)
- Renamed the parameter to be more descriptive (`str` → `input_string`)
- Renamed the counter variable to be more descriptive (`upper_ctr` → `count`)
- Simplified the loop by iterating directly over characters instead of using indices
- Removed the redundant `return` statement inside the loop (it was causing the function to return after checking only the first character)
- Added a docstring to explain the function's purpose
- Improved code formatting and readability with consistent spacing
- Maintained the same behavior as the original function (counting uppercase letters)
